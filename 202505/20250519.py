class Solution:
    """3024. Type of Triangle

    You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of size `3` which can form the
    sides of a triangle.

    * A triangle is called **equilateral** if it has all sides of equal length.

    * A triangle is called **isosceles** if it has exactly two sides of equal length.

    * A triangle is called **scalene** if all its sides are of different lengths.

    Return *a string representing* *the type of triangle that can be formed* *or*
    `"none"` *if it **cannot** form a triangle.*"""
