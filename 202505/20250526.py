    """1857. Largest Color Value in a Directed Graph

    There is a **directed graph** of `n` colored nodes and `m` edges. The nodes are
    numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

    You are given a string `colors` where `colors[i]` is a lowercase English letter
    representing the **color** of the `ith` node in this graph (**0-indexed**). You are
    also given a 2D array `edges` where `edges[j] = [aj, bj]` indicates that there is a
    **directed edge** from node `aj` to node `bj`.

    A valid **path** in the graph is a sequence of nodes `x1 -> x2 -> x3 -> ... -> xk`
    such that there is a directed edge from `xi` to `xi+1` for every `1 <= i < k`. The
    **color value** of the path is the number of nodes that are colored the **most
    frequently** occurring color along that path.

    Return *the **largest color value** of any valid path in the given graph, or* `-1`
    *if the graph contains a cycle*."""
