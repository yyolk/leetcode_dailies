class Solution:
    """2918. Minimum Equal Sum of Two Arrays After Replacing Zeros

    You are given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` consisting of positive integers.

    You have to replace **all** the `0`'s in both arrays with **strictly** positive
    integers such that the sum of elements of both arrays becomes **equal**.

    Return *the **minimum** equal sum you can obtain, or* `-1` *if it is impossible*."""

    def min_sum(self, nums1: list[int], nums2: list[int]) -> int: ...

    minSum = min_sum
