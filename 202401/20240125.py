class Solution:
    """1143. Longest Common Subsequence

    Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return *the length of their longest **common
    subsequence**.* If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

    A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string
    with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of
    the remaining characters.

    * For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

    A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both
    strings.
