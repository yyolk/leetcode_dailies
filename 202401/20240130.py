class Solution:
    """150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

    You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression
    in a [Reverse Polish
    Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

    Evaluate the expression. Return *an integer that represents the value of the
    expression*.

    **Note** that:

    * The valid operators are `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.

    * Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

    * The division between two integers always **truncates toward zero**.

    * There will not be any division by zero.

    * The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.

    * The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a
    **32-bit** integer.
