    You are given an array of strings `arr`. A string `s` is formed by the
    **concatenation** of a **subsequence** of `arr` that has **unique characters**.

    Return *the **maximum** possible length* of `s`.

    A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting
    some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
