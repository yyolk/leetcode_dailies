    """2610. Convert an Array Into a 2D Array With Conditions

    You are given an integer array `nums`. You need to create a 2D array from `nums`
    satisfying the following conditions:

    * The 2D array should contain **only** the elements of the array `nums`.

    * Each row in the 2D array contains **distinct** integers.

    * The number of rows in the 2D array should be **minimal**.

    Return *the resulting array*. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

    **Note** that the 2D array can have a different number of elements on each row.
