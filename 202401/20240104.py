class Solution:
    """2870. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty

    You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` consisting of positive integers.

    There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array **any** number of
    times:

    * Choose **two** elements with **equal** values and **delete** them from the array.

    * Choose **three** elements with **equal** values and **delete** them from the
    array.

    Return *the **minimum** number of operations required to make the array empty, or*
    `-1` *if it is not possible*.
