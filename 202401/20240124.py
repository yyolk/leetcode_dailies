    Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary
    tree is said to be **pseudo-palindromic** if at least one permutation of the node
    values in the path is a palindrome.

    *Return the number of **pseudo-palindromic** paths going from the root node to leaf
    nodes.*
