    """1155. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum

    You have `n` dice, and each die has `k` faces numbered from `1` to `k`.

    Given three integers `n`, `k`, and `target`, return *the number of possible ways
    (out of the* `kn` *total ways)* *to roll the dice, so the sum of the face-up numbers
    equals* `target`. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.
