    """1752. Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated

    Given an array `nums`, return `true` *if the array was originally sorted in non-
    decreasing order, then rotated **some** number of positions (including zero)*.
    Otherwise, return `false`.

    There may be **duplicates** in the original array.

    **Note:** An array `A` rotated by `x` positions results in an array `B` of the same
    length such that `A[i] == B[(i+x) % A.length]`, where `%` is the modulo operation.
