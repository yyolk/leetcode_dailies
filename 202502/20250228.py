class Solution:
    """1092. Shortest Common Supersequence

    Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return *the shortest string that has both*
    `str1` *and* `str2` *as **subsequences***. If there are multiple valid strings,
    return **any** of them.

    A string `s` is a **subsequence** of string `t` if deleting some number of
    characters from `t` (possibly `0`) results in the string `s`."""
