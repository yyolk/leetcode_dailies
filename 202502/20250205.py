    """1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal

    You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length. A **string swap** is an
    operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and
    swap the characters at these indices.

    Return `true` *if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing **at most
    one string swap** on **exactly one** of the strings.* Otherwise, return `false`."""
