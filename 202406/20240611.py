    """1122. Relative Sort Array

    Given two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, the elements of `arr2` are distinct, and all
    elements in `arr2` are also in `arr1`.

    Sort the elements of `arr1` such that the relative ordering of items in `arr1` are
    the same as in `arr2`. Elements that do not appear in `arr2` should be placed at the
    end of `arr1` in **ascending** order.
