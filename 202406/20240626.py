class Solution:
    """1382. Balance a Binary Search Tree

    Given the `root` of a binary search tree, return *a **balanced** binary search tree
    with the same node values*. If there is more than one answer, return **any of
    them**.

    A binary search tree is **balanced** if the depth of the two subtrees of every node
    never differs by more than `1`.
