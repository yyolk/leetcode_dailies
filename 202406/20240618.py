class Solution:
    """826. Most Profit Assigning Work

    You have `n` jobs and `m` workers. You are given three arrays: `difficulty`,
    `profit`, and `worker` where:

    * `difficulty[i]` and `profit[i]` are the difficulty and the profit of the `ith`
    job, and

    * `worker[j]` is the ability of `jth` worker (i.e., the `jth` worker can only
    complete a job with difficulty at most `worker[j]`).

    Every worker can be assigned **at most one job**, but one job can be **completed
    multiple times**.

    * For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays `$1`, then the total
    profit will be `$3`. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is `$0`.

    Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.
