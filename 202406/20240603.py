    """2486. Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence

    You are given two strings `s` and `t` consisting of only lowercase English letters.

    Return *the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of* `s`
    *so that* `t` *becomes a **subsequence** of* `s`.

    A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting
    some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
