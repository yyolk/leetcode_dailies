    """1593. Split a String Into the Max Number of Unique Substrings

    Given a string `s`, return *the maximum number of unique substrings that the given
    string can be split into*.

    You can split string `s` into any list of **non\\-empty substrings**, where the
    concatenation of the substrings forms the original string. However, you must split
    the substrings such that all of them are **unique**.

    A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
