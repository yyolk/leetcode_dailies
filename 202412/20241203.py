    """2109. Adding Spaces to a String

    You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` and a **0-indexed** integer array `spaces`
    that describes the indices in the original string where spaces will be added. Each
    space should be inserted **before** the character at the given index.

    * For example, given `s = "EnjoyYourCoffee"` and `spaces = [5, 9]`, we place spaces
    before `'Y'` and `'C'`, which are at indices `5` and `9` respectively. Thus, we
    obtain `"Enjoy Your Coffee"`.

    Return*the modified string **after** the spaces have been added.*"""

        # Add 0 at the beginning and length of s at the end to handle edges
        return " ".join(s[a:b] for a, b in pairwise(chain([0], spaces, [len(s)])))
