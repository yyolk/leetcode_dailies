class Solution:
    """2471. Minimum Number of Operations to Sort a Binary Tree by Level

    You are given the `root` of a binary tree with **unique values**.

    In one operation, you can choose any two nodes **at the same level** and swap their
    values.

    Return *the minimum number of operations needed to make the values at each level
    sorted in a **strictly increasing order***.

    The **level** of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the
    root node*.*"""
