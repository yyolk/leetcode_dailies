class Solution:
    """689. Maximum Sum of 3 Non-Overlapping Subarrays

    Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, find three non-overlapping
    subarrays of length `k` with maximum sum and return them.

    Return the result as a list of indices representing the starting position of each
    interval (**0-indexed**). If there are multiple answers, return the
    lexicographically smallest one."""
