class Solution:
    """808. Soup Servings

    You have two soups, **A** and **B**, each starting with `n` mL. On every turn, one
    of the following four serving operations is chosen *at random*, each with
    probability `0.25` **independent** of all previous turns:

    * pour 100 mL from type A and 0 mL from type B

    * pour 75 mL from type A and 25 mL from type B

    * pour 50 mL from type A and 50 mL from type B

    * pour 25 mL from type A and 75 mL from type B

    **Note:**

    * There is no operation that pours 0 mL from A and 100 mL from B.

    * The amounts from A and B are poured *simultaneously* during the turn.

    * If an operation asks you to pour **more than** you have left of a soup, pour all
    that remains of that soup.

    The process stops immediately after any turn in which *one of the soups* is used up.

    Return the probability that A is used up *before* B, plus half the probability that
    both soups are used up in the **same turn**. Answers within `10-5` of the actual
    answer will be accepted."""
