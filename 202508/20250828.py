    """3446. Sort Matrix by Diagonals

    You are given an `n x n` square matrix of integers `grid`. Return the matrix such
    that:

    * The diagonals in the **bottom-left triangle** (including the middle diagonal) are
    sorted in **non-increasing order**.

    * The diagonals in the **top-right triangle** are sorted in **non-decreasing
    order**."""
