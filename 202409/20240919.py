    """241. Different Ways to Add Parentheses

    Given a string `expression` of numbers and operators, return *all possible results
    from computing all the different possible ways to group numbers and operators*. You
    may return the answer in **any order**.

    The test cases are generated such that the output values fit in a 32\\-bit integer
    and the number of different results does not exceed `104`.
