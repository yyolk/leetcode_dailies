class Solution:
    """1894. Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk

    There are `n` students in a class numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The teacher will
    give each student a problem starting with the student number `0`, then the student
    number `1`, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number `n - 1`. After
    that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number `0`
    again.

    You are given a **0\\-indexed** integer array `chalk` and an integer `k`. There are
    initially `k` pieces of chalk. When the student number `i` is given a problem to
    solve, they will use `chalk[i]` pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if
    the current number of chalk pieces is **strictly less** than `chalk[i]`, then the
    student number `i` will be asked to **replace** the chalk.

    Return *the **index** of the student that will **replace** the chalk pieces*.
