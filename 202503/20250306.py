class Solution:
    """2965. Find Missing and Repeated Values

    You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer matrix `grid` of size `n * n` with values
    in the range `[1, n2]`. Each integer appears **exactly once** except `a` which
    appears **twice** and `b` which is **missing**. The task is to find the repeating
    and missing numbers `a` and `b`.

    Return *a **0-indexed** integer array* `ans` *of size* `2` *where* `ans[0]` *equals
    to* `a` *and* `ans[1]` *equals to* `b`*.*"""
