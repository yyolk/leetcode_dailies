class Solution:
    """2033. Minimum Operations to Make a Uni-Value Grid

    You are given a 2D integer `grid` of size `m x n` and an integer `x`. In one
    operation, you can **add** `x` to or **subtract** `x` from any element in the
    `grid`.

    A **uni-value grid** is a grid where all the elements of it are equal.

    Return *the **minimum** number of operations to make the grid **uni-value***. If it
    is not possible, return `-1`."""

    def min_operations(self, grid: list[list[int]], x: int) -> int: ...
