class Solution:
    """2529. Maximum Count of Positive Integer and Negative Integer

    Given an array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order, return *the maximum
    between the number of positive integers and the number of negative integers.*

    * In other words, if the number of positive integers in `nums` is `pos` and the
    number of negative integers is `neg`, then return the maximum of `pos` and `neg`.

    **Note** that `0` is neither positive nor negative."""
