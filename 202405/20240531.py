    """260. Single Number III

    Given an integer array `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and
    all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only
    once. You can return the answer in **any order**.

    You must write an algorithm that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses only
    constant extra space.
