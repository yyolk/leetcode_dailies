    """166. Fraction to Recurring Decimal

    Given two integers representing the `numerator` and `denominator` of a fraction,
    return *the fraction in string format*.

    If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.

    If multiple answers are possible, return **any of them**.

    It is **guaranteed** that the length of the answer string is less than `104` for all
    the given inputs."""
