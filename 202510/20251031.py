    """3289. The Two Sneaky Numbers of Digitville

    In the town of Digitville, there was a list of numbers called `nums` containing
    integers from `0` to `n - 1`. Each number was supposed to appear **exactly once** in
    the list, however, **two** mischievous numbers sneaked in an *additional time*,
    making the list longer than usual.

    As the town detective, your task is to find these two sneaky numbers. Return an
    array of size **two** containing the two numbers (in *any order*), so peace can
    return to Digitville."""
