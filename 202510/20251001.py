    """1518. Water Bottles

    There are `num_bottles` water bottles that are initially full of water. You can
    exchange `num_exchange` empty water bottles from the market with one full water
    bottle.

    The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

    Given the two integers `num_bottles` and `num_exchange`, return *the **maximum**
    number of water bottles you can drink*."""

    def num_water_bottles(self, num_bottles: int, num_exchange: int) -> int: ...

    numWaterBottles = num_water_bottles
