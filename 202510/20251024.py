    """2048. Next Greater Numerically Balanced Number

    An integer `x` is **numerically balanced** if for every digit `d` in the number `x`,
    there are **exactly** `d` occurrences of that digit in `x`.

    Given an integer `n`, return *the **smallest numerically balanced** number
    **strictly greater** than* `n`*.*"""
