class Solution:
    """624. Maximum Distance in Arrays

    You are given `m` `arrays`, where each array is sorted in **ascending order**.

    You can pick up two integers from two different arrays (each array picks one) and
    calculate the distance. We define the distance between two integers `a` and `b` to
    be their absolute difference `|a - b|`.

    Return *the maximum distance*.
