    """2053. Kth Distinct String in an Array

    A **distinct string** is a string that is present only **once** in an array.

    Given an array of strings `arr`, and an integer `k`, return *the* `kth` ***distinct
    string** present in* `arr`. If there are **fewer** than `k` distinct strings, return
    *an **empty string*** `""`.

    Note that the strings are considered in the **order in which they appear** in the
    array.
