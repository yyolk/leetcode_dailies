class Solution:
    """592. Fraction Addition and Subtraction

    Given a string `expression` representing an expression of fraction addition and
    subtraction, return the calculation result in string format.

    The final result should be an [irreducible
    fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_fraction). If your final result
    is an integer, change it to the format of a fraction that has a denominator `1`. So
    in this case, `2` should be converted to `2/1`.
