    """1598. Crawler Log Folder

    The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a *change folder*
    operation.

    The operations are described below:

    * `"../"` : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in
    the main folder, **remain in the same folder**).

    * `"./"` : Remain in the same folder.

    * `"x/"` : Move to the child folder named `x` (This folder is **guaranteed to always
    exist**).

    You are given a list of strings `logs` where `logs[i]` is the operation performed by
    the user at the `ith` step.

    The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in `logs` are
    performed.

    Return *the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after
    the change folder operations.*
