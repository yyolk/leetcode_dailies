class Solution:
    """1260. Shift 2D Grid

    Given a 2D `grid` of size `m x n` and an integer `k`. You need to shift the `grid`
    `k` times.

    In one shift operation:

    * Element at `grid[i][j]` moves to `grid[i][j + 1]`.

    * Element at `grid[i][n - 1]` moves to `grid[i + 1][0]`.

    * Element at `grid[m - 1][n - 1]` moves to `grid[0][0]`.

    Return the *2D grid* after applying shift operation `k` times.

    Constraints:

    * `m == grid.length`

    * `n == grid[i].length`

    * `1 <= m <= 50`

    * `1 <= n <= 50`

    * `-1000 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000`

    * `0 <= k <= 100`"""

    def shift_grid(self, grid: list[list[int]], k: int) -> list[list[int]]: ...

    shiftGrid = shift_grid
