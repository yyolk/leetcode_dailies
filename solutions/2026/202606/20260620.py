class Solution:
    """1840. Maximum Building Height

    You want to build `n` new buildings in a city. The new buildings will be built in a
    line and are labeled from `1` to `n`.

    However, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:

    * The height of each building must be a non-negative integer.

    * The height of the first building **must** be `0`.

    * The height difference between any two adjacent buildings **cannot exceed** `1`.

    Additionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of specific
    buildings. These restrictions are given as a 2D integer array `restrictions` where
    `restrictions[i] = [idi, maxHeighti]` indicates that building `idi` must have a
    height **less than or equal to** `maxHeighti`.

    It is guaranteed that each building will appear **at most once** in `restrictions`,
    and building `1` will **not** be in `restrictions`.

    Return *the **maximum possible height** of the **tallest** building*.

    Constraints:

    * `2 <= n <= 109`

    * `0 <= restrictions.length <= min(n - 1, 105)`

    * `2 <= idi <= n`

    * `idi` is **unique**.

    * `0 <= maxHeighti <= 109`"""
