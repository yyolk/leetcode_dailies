    """1807. Evaluate the Bracket Pairs of a String

    You are given a string `s` that contains some bracket pairs, with each pair
    containing a **non-empty** key.

    * For example, in the string `"(name)is(age)yearsold"`, there are **two** bracket
    pairs that contain the keys `"name"` and `"age"`.

    You know the values of a wide range of keys. This is represented by a 2D string
    array `knowledge` where each `knowledge[i] = [keyi, valuei]` indicates that key
    `keyi` has a value of `valuei`.

    You are tasked to evaluate **all** of the bracket pairs. When you evaluate a bracket
    pair that contains some key `keyi`, you will:

    * Replace `keyi` and the bracket pair with the key's corresponding `valuei`.

    * If you do not know the value of the key, you will replace `keyi` and the bracket
    pair with a question mark `"?"` (without the quotation marks).

    Each key will appear at most once in your `knowledge`. There will not be any nested
    brackets in `s`.

    Return *the resulting string after evaluating **all** of the bracket pairs.*

    Constraints:

    * `1 <= s.length <= 105`

    * `0 <= knowledge.length <= 105`

    * `knowledge[i].length == 2`

    * `1 <= keyi.length, valuei.length <= 10`

    * `s` consists of lowercase English letters and round brackets `'('` and `')'`.

    * Every open bracket `'('` in `s` will have a corresponding close bracket `')'`.

    * The key in each bracket pair of `s` will be non-empty.

    * There will not be any nested bracket pairs in `s`.

    * `keyi` and `valuei` consist of lowercase English letters.

    * Each `keyi` in `knowledge` is unique."""
