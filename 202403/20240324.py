    Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is
    in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

    There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return *this repeated number*.

    You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and uses only
    constant extra space.
