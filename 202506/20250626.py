class Solution:
    """2311. Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K

    You are given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `k`.

    Return *the length of the **longest** subsequence of* `s` *that makes up a
    **binary** number less than or equal to* `k`.

    Note:

    * The subsequence can contain **leading zeroes**.

    * The empty string is considered to be equal to `0`.

    * A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting
    some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters."""
