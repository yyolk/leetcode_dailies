class Solution:
    """2099. Find Subsequence of Length K With the Largest Sum

    You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You want to find a
    **subsequence** of `nums` of length `k` that has the **largest** sum.

    Return***any** such subsequence as an integer array of length* `k`.

    A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting
    some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements."""
