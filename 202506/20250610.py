class Solution:
    """3442. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I

    You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

    Your task is to find the **maximum** difference `diff = a1 - a2` between the
    frequency of characters `a1` and `a2` in the string such that:

    * `a1` has an **odd frequency** in the string.

    * `a2` has an **even frequency** in the string.

    Return this **maximum** difference."""

    def max_difference(self, s: str) -> int: ...
