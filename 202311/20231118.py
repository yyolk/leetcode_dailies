    The **frequency** of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.

    You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can
    choose an index of `nums` and increment the element at that index by `1`.

    Return *the **maximum possible frequency** of an element after performing **at
    most*** `k` *operations*.
