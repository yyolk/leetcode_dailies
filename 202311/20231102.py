    Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the number of nodes where the value of
    the node is equal to the **average** of the values in its **subtree***.

    **Note:**

    * The **average** of `n` elements is the **sum** of the `n` elements divided by `n`
    and **rounded down** to the nearest integer.

    * A **subtree** of `root` is a tree consisting of `root` and all of its descendants.
