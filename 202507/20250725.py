class Solution:
    """3487. Maximum Unique Subarray Sum After Deletion

    You are given an integer array `nums`.

    You are allowed to delete any number of elements from `nums` without making it
    **empty**. After performing the deletions, select a subarray of `nums` such that:

    1. All elements in the subarray are **unique**.

    2. The sum of the elements in the subarray is **maximized**.

    Return the **maximum sum** of such a subarray."""
