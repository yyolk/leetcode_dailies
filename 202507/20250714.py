    """1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

    Given `head` which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each
    node in the linked list is either `0` or `1`. The linked list holds the binary
    representation of a number.

    Return the *decimal value* of the number in the linked list.

    The **most significant bit** is at the head of the linked list."""
