class Solution:
    """2843.   Count Symmetric Integers

    You are given two positive integers `low` and `high`.

    An integer `x` consisting of `2 * n` digits is **symmetric** if the sum of the first
    `n` digits of `x` is equal to the sum of the last `n` digits of `x`. Numbers with an
    odd number of digits are never symmetric.

    Return *the **number of symmetric** integers in the range* `[low, high]`."""
