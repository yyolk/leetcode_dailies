    There is a forest with an unknown number of rabbits. We asked n rabbits **"How many
    rabbits have the same color as you?"** and collected the answers in an integer array
    `answers` where `answers[i]` is the answer of the `ith` rabbit.

    Given the array `answers`, return *the minimum number of rabbits that could be in
    the forest*."""
